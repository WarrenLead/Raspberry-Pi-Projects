Wazza's Thermal Detector v1.0

This is my first Raspberry Pi project for the Pico.  

It's for detecting thermals on the ground for flying model aircraft.  The temp is displayed on the OLED display and there is a temp plotter with 4 deg c scale that is updated every second. You can see small rises in temp which may indicate a thermal coming. There is also an alarm that can be turned on and off which indicates fast rises or falls in temp. The range of the p[lotter is 4 deg c and will reset if the temp incerases or decreases by + or - 2 deg C.

The device nees to be small and is powered by a Lipo Battery. It can be attached to a streamer pole but the the temp sensor needs a shield around it to shade it from the sun.

It seems to work quite well.

Parts needed are:
