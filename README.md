Thermal detector

This is my first Raspberry Pi project for the Pico.  

It's for detecting thermals on the ground for flying model aircraft.

The device nees to be small and is powered by a Lipo Battery

Parts needed are: 

 - Raspberry Pi Pico H (with Headers) https://core-electronics.com.au/raspberry-pi-pico-h-with-headers.html
 - OLED Display Module for Raspberry Pi Pico, 1.3inch, SPI/I2C (64Ã—128) https://core-electronics.com.au/oled-display-module-for-raspberry-pi-pico-1-3inch-spi-i2c-64-128.html
 - Maker Pi Pico Mini - Without Raspberry Pi Pico / Pico W (Pre-Soldered Pin Header) https://core-electronics.com.au/maker-pi-pico-mini-without-raspberry-pi-pico-pico-w-pre-soldered-pin-header.html
