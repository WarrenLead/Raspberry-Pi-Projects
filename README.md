# Raspberry-Pi-Projects
Wazza's Thermal Detector v1.0

This is my first Raspberry Pi project for the Pico.  

It's for detecting thermals on the ground for flying model aircraft.

The device nees to be small and is powered by a Lipo Battery

Parts needed are: 

 - Raspberry Pi Pico H (with Headers) https://core-electronics.com.au/raspberry-pi-pico-h-with-headers.html
 - OLED Display Module for Raspberry Pi Pico, 1.3inch, SPI/I2C (64Ã—128) https://core-electronics.com.au/oled-display-module-for-raspberry-pi-pico-1-3inch-spi-i2c-64-128.html
 - Maker Pi Pico Mini - Without Raspberry Pi Pico / Pico W (Pre-Soldered Pin Header) https://core-electronics.com.au/maker-pi-pico-mini-without-raspberry-pi-pico-pico-w-pre-soldered-pin-header.html
 - PiicoDev Precision Temperature Sensor TMP117 https://core-electronics.com.au/catalogsearch/result/?q=tmp117
 - Polymer Lithium Ion Battery (LiPo) 3.7V 1100mAh https://core-electronics.com.au/polymer-lithium-ion-battery-1000mah-38458.html

Install the piicodev package in Thonny by selecting Tools, Manage Packages, then search for Piicodev 
or you can Download the individual PiicoDev Libraries from https://github.com/CoreElectronics/CE-PiicoDev-PyPI
